    <h2><strong>Digital Magazine Cover Project</strong></h2>
    <article id="Digital Magazine Cover Project description">
        <p>The Digital Magazine Cover Project involved careful attention to detail. 
           Created with Adobe Photoshop, the purpose of this project is to create a digital magazine cover that features a celebrity. 
        </p>
        <p>Maribella, the women on the cover page is not a real celebrity but looks like a celebrity! 
           With the power of Adobe Photoshop, the main technique used to achieve the perfect cover page was Selections and Masks. 
           Font also played a huge role in achieving a magazine look that would be fun to read. 
           This magazine “Classic” is not a real magazine but I thought best fit the theme because of the model being dressed in a very classic glamours look. 
           Using the Layer Styles technique, I was able to create a drop shadow gradient effect to the magazine title.
