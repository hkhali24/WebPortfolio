    <h2>Typography Article</h2>
    <p>The use of typography is in our everyday lives, from reading a school textbook or a magazine to writing 
        an article or creating a logo. The purpose of typography is to clearly communicate to the reader your 
        message. This article explores typography through websites that were found on <a href="https://www.siteinspire.com/"> Siteinspire </a>
        and are <a href= "https://danfinkstudio.com/"> Dan Fink Studio </a> and 
        <a href= "https://wearedesigngoat.com/"> We are Designgoat.</a> 
        Both are web pages for interior design companies. </p>

    <p>The web page for Dan Fink Studio uses monospaced font style for headings and a Sans Serif style 
        font for paragraphs. These two font styles make the text easy to follow and to read. 
        The monospaced headings are clear to the visitor on what the section is about. 
        The paragraphs are beautifully structured in a Sans Serif style font which is popular for the clean appeal.

    <p>Whereas the web page for We are Designgoat can be elevated with the use of structure. 
       The font style used is Sans Serif, which is also used by Dan Fink Studio however, the font is placed 
       on the images and is in red color. I think if the web page had headings that were slightly larger 
       and or included font style variety it would make it more interesting for the visitors to interact. 
       If the font color was black and certain words were in bold it would be visually appealing. 
       It will also be more clear to read the message if it was not on the images.
