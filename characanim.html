    <h2><strong>Character Animation Project</strong></h2>
    <article id="Character Animation Project Description">
    <p>This clip was designed in Adobe Animate for a character design project and the purpose of the project 
        was to create a short animation of a character performing a simple action. My character is simply rollerblading.!</p>

    <p>In this project the first step was to build a character from scratch using a variety of Adobe Animate tools. 
        The tools I employed were the Rectangle Primitive and Oval Primitive tool that allowed me to build my character from head to toe. 
        These two tools provided me with versatility to modify my character&#39s proportion. 
        Along with the Selection Tool and the Free Transform Tool gave me the flexibility to create a hairstyle, 
        rotate the characters body parts, and resize the characters shirt design. 
        The importance of creating layers and naming layers helped me stay organized throughout this project. 
    </p>

    <p>For the colors, the Paint Bucket and the Eyedropper tool were essential in keeping the character stylish 
        and well balanced. Also keeping in mind that character is rollerblading, I had to draw proper rollerblading 
        gear, rollerblades and a helmet for safety! 
    </p>

    <p>After developing my character and converting it into a symbol, I was able to apply an action 
        to the character which is rollerblading. To ensure my character smoothly glided across the stage, 
        I used a Motion Tween technique along with applying easing to create a soft, slow ease out.
