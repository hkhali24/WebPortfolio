    <h2><strong>Photo Restoration Project</strong></h2>
    <article id="photorestoreprojdescription">
    <p>In this project I explored restoring an old photograph using the tools available in Photoshop. This photograph was found on the WikiMedia Commons, Damaged Photographs, under the Faded color photographs category, titled Ujkigyos:
       <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Faded_color_photographs#/media/File:Ujkigyos.jpg">Ujkigyos countryside.</a>
       In this project I explored Adobe Photoshop Tools: Spot Healing Tool Brush &#38; the Neural Filters. 
       With the help of these powerful Adobe Photoshop tools restoring the damaged photograph was a success. 
    </p>
    <p>After cleaning up as much of the damage on the photograph as possible.
       Using the Spot Healing Tool Brush, I focused on the areas of the photo that had markings which were mainly around the horse and the sky. 
       Then I applied Photoshop&#39; Neural Filter, with the Colorize filter it added color to the faded photograph which brought the photo back to life.</p>
